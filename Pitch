1. Problem Statement
Current State in Finance & Planning Operations
Organizations running Oracle EPM Cloud / Essbase rely heavily on structured cube data for planning, forecasting, and variance analysis. However:

High Technical Dependency
Business users must depend on IT/BI teams or power users to write MDX queries or SmartView reports.

Slow Turnaround
Ad hoc queries can take hours or days because of internal ticket queues and competing priorities.

Limited Accessibility
Non-technical teams shy away from cube querying because the interfaces are not intuitive.

Low Data Democratization
Only a small fraction of available cube data is directly accessed by decision-makers.

Security and Governance Constraints
In EPM Cloud, REST APIs have limitations (no direct dimension or MDX query access), making real-time self-service even harder.

Impact on the Business:

Delayed decision-making in areas like cash flow forecasting, budget reallocation, and cost control.

IT/BI resource drain on repetitive query/report requests.

Reduced ROI on expensive EPM investments due to underutilization.

2. Proposed Solution
An AI-powered, offline-capable, Natural Language Querying Platform for Oracle EPM Cloud / Essbase that removes the need for MDX or technical reporting knowledge.

Core Components:

Metadata-Aware RAG Layer

Uses cube metadata (dimensions, members, aliases) extracted via bulk export or scheduled sync.

Embeds this metadata in a local vector database for semantic search — works even in offline/restricted environments.

Natural Language to Structured Query Conversion

Converts user questions (“What was revenue in APAC last quarter?”) into safe, validated EPM queries.

Executes via available APIs, SmartView automation scripts, or pre-processed exports.

Validation & Security Enforcement

Applies role-based security to ensure queries only return data the user is entitled to.

Full audit trail of all queries and responses.

Learning Feedback Loop

Improves intent recognition over time based on user corrections.

3. How it Works (High Level Flow)
Metadata Collection → Regular offline export from EPM (via SmartView, reports, or job scheduler) → stored locally.

Embedding Creation → LangChain + local embedding model (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2 in SentenceTransformers) → stored in FAISS / Chroma DB.

User Query → Parsed into semantic search → relevant members/dimensions retrieved.

Query Assembly → Mapped to valid EPM execution method (SmartView macro, saved report run, etc.).

Response Delivery → Returned in user-friendly format (pivot table, chart, summary text).

4. Differentiators
Offline-Capable → Works without internet access using local embeddings.

Zero MDX Exposure to End Users → Technical complexity hidden completely.

Security-First → Adheres to EPM role-based data access.

Adaptive → Gets smarter over time with minimal IT overhead.

Cross-Platform Ready → Can extend to other cube/data warehouse systems with similar structures.

5. KPIs & Measurable Business Value
KPI	Current State	Target After Implementation
Ad hoc query turnaround time	4–24 hrs	< 2 min
IT/BI workload for report requests	100% baseline	-40% to -60%
Business user self-service adoption	< 25%	> 70%
Decision latency	1–2 days	Same-day
ROI on EPM investment	Low utilization	Full-scale utilization with direct business access

6. Potential Future Roadmap
Multilingual Support → Query in any language.

Voice Interface → Ask cube questions via voice commands.

Predictive Insights → AI not just answering, but forecasting.

Cross-System Queries → Join EPM data with ERP, CRM, or data warehouse data.

Mobile App Integration → Quick insights on the go.
